# MRF_undersampling_optimization
To reproduce the results from the paper *Mitigating undersampling errors in Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting by sequence optimization* one has to download the following Python files: 
+ main_UEE_phase.py
+ UEE_phase.py
+ Optimisation.py.

The following dictionary files have to be downloaded in the working directory for the program to function correctly: 
+ Single spiral.npz
+ reference_map.npz, 

where *Single spiral.npz* contains the spiral from the scanner we used and *reference_map.npz* the reference brain scan used for the optimisations. 
The Environment variables can be found in *environment.yml*.

## main_UEE_phase.py
TEST

## UEE_phase.py

## Optimisation.py
